Museums & Zoo Thiruvananthapuram

Thiruvananthapuram Museums & Zoo  owe its orgin to the joint efforts of Mr. J.A. Brown, former Director of Thiruvananthapuram Observatory, and General Cullen, a former British Resident. A committee was formed in 1855 with the Maharaja of Travancore as patron, General Cullen as President, the Elaya Raja as Vice President and Mr. Allen Brown as Secretary of the Committee and the Director of Museum.

This Museum was thrown open to the public in September 1857. But the Museum by itself could not attract the people much, and therefore a Zoo and a Park known as public gardens were started in 1859. By 1880, a new building designed by Robert Chisholm, Architect to the Governor of Madras, was constructed and the Museum was shifted to the present architectural beauty.

The new museum was named after Lord Napier, the then Governor of the Madras Presidency. The adjoining Sree Chitra Art Gallery was established in the year 1935, the Natural History Museum in 1964 and the K C S Panickear Art Gallery in 1979.The Thiruvananthapuram Zoo and Museums Complex was initially established as to provide a means of recreation for the public. However, after the concerns of natural and environment degradation came to prominence, conservation became the catchword in all circles. The Thiruvananthapuram Zoo and Museums Complex, situated in 55 acres of land, right in the heart of Thiruvananthapura City, is at the forefront of such efforts, especially since the whole complex is wide spread in a large botanical garden. Today, the zoo houses over 100 species of indigenous and exotic animals. The number of species of flora in the entire botanical garden is much higher.

Botanical Garden
  


Public garden owes its existence and origin to the efforts and endeavors of Mr. Allen J Braun (1831-1903). The project was taken up in 1859. Several plants and flowers were reared.


In 1891 Mr. Ingleby who had been trained at Kew Garden London, was appointed as the superintendent of Botanical garden and he held that office for 6 years during which time the garden labour was systematically organized and brought to bear upon itâ€™s steady improvement. He has prepared the layout and planting.



 

50 acres of hill and dale are tastefully laid out in paths and terraces lawns and lakes, shrubberies, flowerbeds and conservatories interspersed with the runs and cages of the Zoo. Beginning from the lower level of the lake, the ground rises tier an tier till it spreads in to an extensive terrace converted in to an ornamental garden known as the top garden on which the museum stands. Grassy slopes leading down to the lake with clumps of golden bamboos and stately tree from the chief feature of lower garden.

The garden has more than 200 species of trees, thousands of ornamental plants, anthuriums, orchids in its diverse collection. It provides excellent opportunity for students of Botany to undertake various studies regarding plants. Botanical garden continues to be one of the co-ordinators of the Trivandrum flower show, the major event of the State and the Director of Museums and Zoos continues to be the convenor of the event.
