    	<h3>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO, /ˈɪsroʊ/) (Hindi; IAST: bhārtīya antrik ṣ anusandhān sa ṅ g ṭ han) is the
space agency of the Government of India headquartered in the city of Bengaluru. Its vision is to "harness space technology for
national development while pursuing space science research and planetary
exploration". [8]
Space Research (INCOSPAR) was established in the tenure of Jawaharlal Nehru
The Indian National Committee for
[9][10][11][12][13]
Indian Space Research
Organisation
under the Department of
Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1962, with the urging of scientist Vikram Sarabhai recognizing the need in space research.
INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969, [14] also under the DAE. [15][16] In 1972, Government of India setup a Space
Commission and the Department of Space (DOS), [17] bringing ISRO under the DOS. The establishment of ISRO thus
institutionalized space research activities in India. [18] It is managed by the DOS, which reports to the prime minister of
India. [19]

ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, which was launched by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975. [20] It was named after
the mathematician Aryabhata. In 1980, Rohini became the first satellite to be placed in orbit by an Indian-made launch vehicle,
SLV-3. ISRO subsequently developed two other rockets: the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching satellites into
polar orbits and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites into geostationary orbits. These
rockets have launched numerous communications satellites and Earth observation satellites. Satellite navigation systems like
GAGAN and IRNSS have been deployed. In January 2014, ISRO used an indigenous cryogenic engine in a GSLV-D5 launch
of the GSAT-14. [21][22</h3></center>
