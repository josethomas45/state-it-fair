	<center><h1>MORE DETAILS</h1>
	<h3>ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, which was launched by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975. [20] It was named after
the mathematician Aryabhata. In 1980, Rohini became the first satellite to be placed in orbit by an Indian-made launch vehicle,
SLV-3. ISRO subsequently developed two other rockets: the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching satellites into
polar orbits and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites into geostationary orbits. These
rockets have launched numerous communications satellites and Earth observation satellites. Satellite navigation systems like
GAGAN and IRNSS have been deployed. In January 2014, ISRO used an indigenous cryogenic engine in a GSLV-D5 launch
of the GSAT-14.single rocket (PSLV-C37), a world record. [26][27] ISRO launched its heaviest rocket, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle- Administrator K. Sivan (Chairman) [3]
Mark III (GSLV-Mk III), on 5 June 2017 and placed a communications satellite GSAT-19 in orbit. With this launch, ISRO Primary
spaceport
Mars Orbiter Mission, on 5 November 2013, which entered Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, making India the first nation to
succeed on its maiden attempt to Mars, as well as the first space agency in Asia to reach Mars orbit. [24]
On 18 June 2016, ISRO
launched twenty satellites in a single vehicle, [25] and on 15 February 2017, ISRO launched one hundred and four satellites in a
became capable of launching 4-ton heavy satellites into GTO. On 22 July 2019, ISRO launched its second lunar mission
Chandrayaan-2, which consists of an orbiter, lander and rover, to study the lunar geology and the distribution of lunar water.</h3><br><br><br>
