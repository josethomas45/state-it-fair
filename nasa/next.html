			  <h1>NASA</h1>
			  <h3>NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System;[10] advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program;[11] exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons;[12] and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs
Main article: Creation of NASA
From 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 
(NACA) had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the
 supersonic Bell X-1.[14] In the early 1950s, there was a challenge
  to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical
   Year (1957â€“58), resulting in the American Project Vanguard among others.
    After the Soviet launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) 
    on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own 
    fledgling space efforts. The US Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to
     national security and technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik crisis"),
      urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his 
      advisers counseled more deliberate measures. On January 12, 1958, 
      NACA organized a "Special Committee on Space Technology",
       headed by Guyford Stever.[9] On January 14, 1958, 
       NACA Director Hugh Dryden published "A National Research Program for 
Space Technology" stating:[15] NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for
 Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation, 
 encouraging peaceful applications in space science.[7][8][9] Since its 
 establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA,
  including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and 
  later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and
   is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space
    Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for
     the Launch Services Program which provides oversight of launch operations and 
     countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.</h3> <a href="index.html">PREVIOUS PAGE</a></center>
